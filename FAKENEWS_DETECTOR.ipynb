The legislation would provide $36.5 billion in emergency relief as Puerto Rico in particular struggles to regain electricity and other basic services following destructive hurricanes. The House of Representatives approved the bill earlier this month. The Trump administration already has indicated it will seek another round of emergency relief from Congress. \",\n          \"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - About a thousand Hungarians protested on Friday against a crackdown on the main opposition party Jobbik which has been  threatened by a record political campaign fine that the party leader describes as a  death sentence  for democracy. Despite the gloomy rhetoric and Jobbik saying it was fighting for survival, support for the demonstration was well down on other similar rallies over the past year. Hungarians will vote for a new parliament in April and Prime Minister Viktor Orban s conservative, anti-migrant Fidesz party is far ahead in the polls, with Jobbik its nearest rival. Jobbik, once on the far right, has turned toward the center in a bid to attract more support and is now campaigning nationwide against Orban, depicting him as the leader of a criminal gang. Orban, rejecting the charges, says his financial standing is  an open book . Last week the state audit office (ASZ) ruled Jobbik had bought political posters far below market prices, breaching rules on political funding, then it slapped a 663 million forint ($2.5 million) penalty on the party. The protesters, waving Jobbik flags and posters deriding the ruling elite, gathered outside the headquarters of Orban s Fidesz party.  What we see unfolding is not an audit office investigation. It is not an official penalty. This is a death sentence with Jobbik s name on it. But in reality, it is a death sentence for Hungarian democracy,  Jobbiik leader Gabor Vona told the crowd. A government spokesman could not comment immediately on his remarks. ASZ chairman Laszlo Domokos is a former Fidesz lawmaker, whom Jobbik and other critics accuse of making decisions in favor of Orban. The audit office denies that. On Friday, ASZ again called on Jobbik to submit information that would challenge its findings, saying it acted fully within its rights throughout the probe. The ruling Fidesz party and the government have denied any involvement in the ASZ probe.  This case has nothing to do with the election campaign,  Orban aide Janos Lazar said on Thursday. For over a year Fidesz has targeted Jobbik, whose move to the center could upend the longstanding status quo of a dominant Fidesz with weaker opponents to its left and its right, said analyst Zoltan Novak at the Centre for Fair Political Analysis. Gyorgy Illes, a 67-year-old pensioner attending the rally, said he used to be a Socialist supporter but got disillusioned as the party struggled to overcome its internal divisions.  This ASZ probe is a clear sign that Orban is way past any remedy. It is a ruthless attack on everything we hold dear. Democracy, the rule of law, equality, you name it,  he said. \",\n          \"BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of interfering in its internal affairs and said it had lodged a complaint after U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law an act laying the groundwork for possible U.S. navy visits to self-ruled Taiwan. Tensions have risen in recent days after a senior Chinese diplomat threatened China would invade Taiwan if any U.S. warships made port visits to the island which China claims as its own territory. On Monday, Chinese jets carried out  island encirclement patrols  around Taiwan, with state media showing pictures of bombers with cruise missiles slung under their wings as they carried out the exercise. On Tuesday, Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2018 fiscal year, which authorizes the possibility of mutual visits by navy vessels between Taiwan and the United States. Such visits would be the first since the United States ended formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 and established ties with Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said while the Taiwan sections of the law were not legally binding, they seriously violate the  One China  policy and  constitute an interference in China s internal affairs .   China is resolutely opposed to this, and we have already lodged stern representations with the U.S. government,  Lu told a daily news briefing. China is firmly opposed to any official exchanges, military contact, or arms sales between Taiwan and the United States, he added.  Proudly democratic Taiwan has become increasingly concerned with the ramped up Chinese military presence, that has included several rounds of Chinese air force drills around the island in recent months.  Taiwan is confident of its defenses and responded quickly to the Chinese air force drills this week, its government said, denouncing the rise in China s military deployments as irresponsible. Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang, speaking to Taiwan media in comments reported late on Wednesday, said the defense ministry had kept a close watch on the patrols and responded immediately and properly. Taiwan  can ensure there are no concerns at all about national security, and people can rest assured , Huang said. Both sides of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which separates Taiwan from its giant neighbor, have a responsibility to protect peace and stability, he added.  Such a raised military posture that may impact upon and harm regional peace and stability and cross-strait ties does not give a feeling of responsibility, and the international community does not look favorably upon this,  Huang was quoted as saying. Relations have soured considerably since Tsai Ing-wen, who leads Taiwan s independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, won presidential elections last year. China suspects Tsai wants to declare the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan s security. Taiwan is well equipped with mostly U.S. weapons but has been pressing for more advanced equipment to deal with what it sees as a rising threat from China. The United States is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

You can t make this stuff up. And now the picture is circulating on social media.In the image, a North Korean soldier can be seen on the right-hand corner of the picture peering in through a window and photographing Tillerson and a US Army general, Business Insider reports.The photo was taken inside the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which was created after the Korean War on what is now the most heavily armed border in the world, and obviously the most spied upon.NBC reporter Brad Jaffy tweeted out a version of the photo, which he zoomed in on, calling it  Rear Window. Rear Window: North Korean soldier takes a photo of Rex Tillerson at the DMZ pic.twitter.com/EHCIR3Fjo6  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) March 17, 2017The original photo can be seen here.Tillerson announced on Friday at a news conference in Seoul that military action against North Korea is  an option  if the threat from its nuclear weapons program rises to a level  that we believe requires action. Tillerson told reporters that  all of the options are on the table. According to the Korea Herald, Tillerson cut his recent visit short with South Korean officials due to  fatigue. The newspaper reported that Tillerson did not have lunch or dinner with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se and acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn during his visit there.Tillerson spent several hours meeting with Japanese officials, which included dinner meetings, the paper noted, according to The Hill.The secretary of State reportedly did hold talks with both South Korean officials regarding the threat posed by North Korea s nuclear program.And that must have been before  fatigue  set in. On Twitter, Trump said that North Korea was  behaving very badly. South Korea s Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of former President Park Geun-hye in March over a corruption scandal. In contrast, the U.S. has failed to address its newly minted president s growing list of scandals. Tillerson, too, has his own scandal to deal with.As for the North Korean soldier spying on Tillerson, perhaps if he wore spy glasses and a fake mustache no one would have noticed. The soldier has better access to the Secretary of State than U.S. reporters do.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\",\n          \"Join Patrick every week here at 21WIRE.TV for news, views and analysis on all top stories domestically and abroad THIS WEEK: Episode 4 The New World Order  Did Great Britain regain control of its former American colonies by stealth?

one term member of congress turned radio host walsh made a name for himself by being an outspoken critic of the obama administration and went from being a selfdescribed moderate to a full fledged tea partier now we all know how heartless he was when he called on the obama admin to secure the boarder with moats and alligators but now he s exposed himself as truly one of the most backwards honking

united states  first africanamerican president was more racist than the following the trail of tears slavery japanese internment or jim crow these are just some but certainly not all of the dark

trying to officially be the party of racism and sheer stupidityand while republicans go on and on about how democrats don t respect the will of the people they decide their best and brightest ought to

have decided to double down on the hopes that their precious white voters would ride in and save the day it didn t work in  it certainly won t work in  and considering president obama s approval rating is at a five year high of  percent insulting his election as  racist  and insulting the intelligence of his voters certainly won t help make the gop s casethis is a guy who accused tammy duckworth who beat him in his reelection bid of politicizing her war record and injuries sustained in combat this is the guy who after his term ended attempted to forego paying child support because

move on to tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on friday it was not clear late on thursday evening that trump and the republican leaders who crafted the bill had enough support to pass it meaning they now risk defeat in their first attempt at major legislation and may fail to deliver on a key campaign pledge we have been promising the american people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because its collapsing and its failing families and tomorrow were proceeding house speaker paul ryan told reporters after an evening allhands meeting he ignored reporters who asked if he had secured the votes to pass the bill ryan and leaders in the house of representatives were forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill formally called the american health care act earlier on thursday dealing trump an embarrassing setback the vote had been symbolically planned for the anniversary of former democratic president barack obama signing his namesake healthcare law the affordable care act in  it was supposed to have been trumps first legislative victory trump and his fellow republicans had pledged to replace obamacare which they view as too intrusive and too expensive but after a week of calling republican lawmakers and bringing them into the oval office for meetings trump failed to close the deal with two different factions within his party on time for the planned thursday vote conservatives felt the bill did not go far enough to repeal obamacare and moderates felt the plan could hurt their constituents house republican leaders had signaled they were ready to work through the weekend to figure out a way to reconcile their differences as the healthcare drama unfolded on capitol hill trump played it cool taking a break from negotiations to hang out with some truckers climbing into the cab of a longhaul transport truck parked on the back driveway of the white house and blowing the horn a few times he told reporters the vote would be close but he remained optimistic i think were doing well well find out in about three hours he said just as reports began to surface that the vote had been postponed by evening trump sent his top lieutenants to a dramatic meeting on capitol hill on thursday night with an ultimatum he was done talking according to representative chris collins of new york a top trump ally white house budget director mick mulvaney told house republicans that trump wanted a vote the president has said he wants a vote tomorrow up or down collins said if for any reason it is down we are just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda such as tax reform collins told reporters after leaving the meeting however the vote has been seen by financial markets as a crucial test of trumps ability to work with congress to deliver on his other priorities such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending even if their replacement plan does eventually get approval from the house the legislation faces a potentially tough fight in the republicancontrolled senate the house and senate had hoped to deliver a new healthcare bill to trump by april  when congress is scheduled to begin a twoweek spring break the republicans have a majority in the house but because of united democratic opposition can afford to lose only  republican votes by thursday morning nbc news said that  republicans had planned to vote no or were leaning that way north carolina congressman mark meadows the chairman of the pivotal conservative bloc known as the freedom caucus said he and others were struggling to support the plan i am desperately trying to get to yes and i think the president knows that i told him that personally meadows said however after thursday

gained insurance coverage through the law the house replacement plan would rescind the taxes created by obamacare repeal a penalty against people who do not buy coverage slash funding for the medicaid program for the poor and disabled and modify tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans house leaders agreed to four pages of lastminute amendments to the bill including allowing states to choose which essential benefits are required in healthcare insurance plans and keeping a  percent surcharge on medicare for highincome americans for six years it was unclear whether that was enough representative trent franks a freedom caucus member who had been undeclared on his position on the bill said he liked the changes its going in the right direction franks said outside the house  the amendments will give states more money for maternal health and mental health said representative jeff fortenberry a nebraska moderate who still has not said how he will vote uncertainty over the

first africanamerican president was more racist than the following the trail of tears slavery japanese internment or jim crow these are just some but certainly not all of the dark racist brutalities

officially be the party of racism and sheer stupidityand while republicans go on and on about how democrats don t respect the will of the people they decide their best and brightest ought to insult

decided to double down on the hopes that their precious white voters would ride in and save the day it didn t work in  it certainly won t work in  and considering president obama s approval rating is at a five year high of  percent insulting his election as  racist  and insulting the intelligence of his voters certainly won t help make the gop s casethis is a guy who accused tammy duckworth who beat him in his reelection bid of politicizing her war record and injuries sustained in combat this is the guy who after his term ended attempted to forego paying child support because he was

tax reform if they do not get behind new healthcare legislation and support it in a vote on friday it was not clear late on thursday evening that trump and the republican leaders who crafted the bill had enough support to pass it meaning they now risk defeat in their first attempt at major legislation and may fail to deliver on a key campaign pledge we have been promising the american people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because its collapsing and its failing families and tomorrow were proceeding house speaker paul ryan told reporters after an evening allhands meeting he ignored reporters who asked if he had secured the votes to pass the bill ryan and leaders in the house of representatives were forced to postpone a vote on their healthcare bill formally called the american health care act earlier on thursday dealing trump an embarrassing setback the vote had been symbolically planned for the anniversary of former democratic president barack obama signing his namesake healthcare law the affordable care act in  it was supposed to have been trumps first legislative victory trump and his fellow republicans had pledged to replace obamacare which they view as too intrusive and too expensive but after a week of calling republican lawmakers and bringing them into the oval office for meetings trump failed to close the deal with two different factions within his party on time for the planned thursday vote conservatives felt the bill did not go far enough to repeal obamacare and moderates felt the plan could hurt their constituents house republican leaders had signaled they were ready to work through the weekend to figure out a way to reconcile their differences as the healthcare drama unfolded on capitol hill trump played it cool taking a break from negotiations to hang out with some truckers climbing into the cab of a longhaul transport truck parked on the back driveway of the white house and blowing the horn a few times he told reporters the vote would be close but he remained optimistic i think were doing well well find out in about three hours he said just as reports began to surface that the vote had been postponed by evening trump sent his top lieutenants to a dramatic meeting on capitol hill on thursday night with an ultimatum he was done talking according to representative chris collins of new york a top trump ally white house budget director mick mulvaney told house republicans that trump wanted a vote the president has said he wants a vote tomorrow up or down collins said if for any reason it is down we are just going to move forward with additional parts of his agenda such as tax reform collins told reporters after leaving the meeting however the vote has been seen by financial markets as a crucial test of trumps ability to work with congress to deliver on his other priorities such as tax cuts and infrastructure spending even if their replacement plan does eventually get approval from the house the legislation faces a potentially tough fight in the republicancontrolled senate the house and senate had hoped to deliver a new healthcare bill to trump by april  when congress is scheduled to begin a twoweek spring break the republicans have a majority in the house but because of united democratic opposition can afford to lose only  republican votes by thursday morning nbc news said that  republicans had planned to vote no or were leaning that way north carolina congressman mark meadows the chairman of the pivotal conservative bloc known as the freedom caucus said he and others were struggling to support the plan i am desperately trying to get to yes and i think the president knows that i told him that personally meadows said however after thursday nights meeting he was still a

through the law the house replacement plan would rescind the taxes created by obamacare repeal a penalty against people who do not buy coverage slash funding for the medicaid program for the poor and disabled and modify tax subsidies that help individuals buy plans house leaders agreed to four pages of lastminute amendments to the bill including allowing states to choose which essential benefits are required in healthcare insurance plans and keeping a  percent surcharge on medicare for highincome americans for six years it was unclear whether that was enough representative trent franks a freedom caucus member who had been undeclared on his position on the bill said he liked the changes its going in the right direction franks said outside the house  the amendments will give states more
